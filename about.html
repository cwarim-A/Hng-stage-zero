                <p data-testid="test-about-bio">
                    Hi, I’m Quam, a passionate Frontend Developer dedicated to crafting visually appealing and user-friendly web
                    experiences. I enjoy transforming ideas into interactive digital products that not only look great but also work
                    seamlessly across all devices.
                    
                    My journey into web development started with a curiosity about how websites function behind the scenes. Over time, that
                    curiosity grew into a strong passion for building responsive, accessible, and high-performing applications using HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, React, and Next.js.
                    
                    I’m always eager to learn new technologies and continuously improve my craft. Recently, I’ve been expanding my skills
                    into TypeScript and backend development with Node.js and NestJS, aiming to become a well-rounded engineer capable of
                    delivering full-stack solutions.
                    
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends, reading about technology, and learning the Arabic language. I
                    believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and using technology to make a positive impact.
                    
                    If you’d like to collaborate or just chat about tech and innovation, feel free to reach out — I’m always open to new
                    opportunities and ideas.

                <em>
                    Hey Quam,
                    
                    I hope when you’re reading this, you’re smiling — not because everything went perfectly, but because you’ve grown
                    stronger, wiser, and more confident through it all. Remember where you started, the moments of doubt, and how you kept
                    pushing forward, one line of code at a time.
                    
                    You’ve spent hours learning, building, and experimenting. Never forget that your consistency, even on the days when
                    progress felt slow, is what brought you here. The late nights debugging, the endless tutorials, and the quiet
                    determination — all of it mattered.
                    
                    Keep your curiosity alive. Keep creating things that excite you. Don’t lose the humility that makes you approachable or
                    the hunger that keeps you improving. The world of tech moves fast, but you don’t have to chase trends — just keep
                    building meaningful things that make an impact.
                    
                    Also, remember to rest. Success isn’t just about what you achieve, but who you become along the way. Be kind to
                    yourself. Appreciate your journey. You’ve done so much already — and the best is still ahead.
                    
                    Keep learning. Keep growing. Keep believing.
                    Your past self is proud of you.
                    
                    — Quam (your earlier version)
                </em>

            <h3 class="extra-thoughts-header">Extra Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                I believe growth comes from curiosity, persistence, and stepping out of my comfort zone. For me, development isn’t just
                about writing code — it’s about creating meaningful, user-centered experiences. I value collaboration, continuous
                learning, and using my skills to build solutions that add real value and inspire others.
